(** {1 Feature Vector indexing} *)

(** Feature Vector indexing (see Schulz 2004) for efficient forward
    and backward subsumption on Horn Clauses.

    This allows to retrieve clauses that (potentially) subsume
    or are subsumed by a given query clause.

    A version for any type, once its features are provided, is also included.
*)

type labels = Index_intf.labels

type feature =
  | N of int
  | S of ID.Set.t
  | M of int ID.Map.t
  | L of labels

type feature_vector = feature IArray.t
(** a vector of feature *)

module type HasFeatures = sig
  include Set.OrderedType (* order is only for usage in sets *)
  type feature_func
  val compute_feature : feature_func -> t -> feature option
  (** HasFeatures: This module allows base feature vector index FV_IDX to be parameterized by internal type of the feature functions it uses. This in turn allows to simultaneously reuse retrieval logic from FV_IDX and change the query type to be different from the type of the indexed elements. For example subsuming clauses may be queried directly by literals and labels bypassing the clause construction. (Note that modules HasFeatures and CLAUSE provide only a destructive view to their data. ) If compute_feature f e = None for any feature f, the element e won't be added to the index and its queries find nothing. *)
